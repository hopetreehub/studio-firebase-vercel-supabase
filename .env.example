# Firebase Admin SDK Configuration (for server-side usage)
# This is for the service account. If you deploy to a Firebase environment (App Hosting, Functions),
# this might be automatically configured. For local development,
# set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of your service account key JSON file.
# Example: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"
# The FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID is used as a fallback check in firebase/admin.ts
# if GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is not set but the app is in a Firebase managed environment.
# You can usually find this in your service account key file as "client_id" or similar, or in GCP IAM.
